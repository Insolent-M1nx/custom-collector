# Custom Artifactcollector

The [artifactcollector](https://github.com/forensicanalysis/artifactcollector) can be customized to your needs. This repository shows some examples for this.

## zip-collector

The [zip-collector](zip-collector/main.go) is a simple example that stores the collected files in a zip file instead of the database.
